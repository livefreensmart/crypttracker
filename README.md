**CrypTTracker** is a work-in-progress tool for investigating wallet transfers on the STEEM blockchain.

This tool will aid in pinpointing the main account the voting ring uses for withdrawing STEEM. It will also help collect accounts related to a voting ring.

## Python packages
Once Python is installed, install the required packages in your virtual environment
* [beem ](https://github.com/holgern/beem)
* lxml

## Roadmap
* Discord integration or a website
* Consider SteemSQL subscription for faster response time
* Retrieve accounts transferring to the account in question
* Retrieve different accounts using a given wallet address

## Contribution
Pull requests, comments, opening issues are appreciated.
